# What's the "Music Discord bot with C"?

A light-weight music Discord bot using Orca for it's bot.

It's easy to use and install.

# How to download and use it?

1 - Use git clone https://github.com/ThePedroo/C-Music-Discord-Bot.git

2 - Install and build [Orca](https://github.com/cee-studio/orca).

3 - Install clang / GCC.

4 - Edit config.json with your TOKEN.

5 - Fill the URL of the Lavalink node

5 - info - Doesn't have a [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink) node? Setup it on [replit.com](https://replit.com/).
  
## Before we continue...

The bot use sqlite3 for save the channelId that the user is in it, so you will need to install sqlite3 with:
```bash
apt install sqlite3
```

6 - **Replace the Orca "discord-gateway.c" & "websockets.c" [inside orca/common] file with the one in this repository for make the bot really works, not replacing it can cause "Session is no longer valid", not replacing the websockets.c can cause really high CPU usage if the Lavalink goes down.**

7 - If you did everything correct, use:
```bash
clang main.c -o main.out -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g -pthread -ldiscord -lcurl -lcrypto -lpthread -lm -lsqlite3 && ./main.out
```
or
```bash
gcc main.c -o main.out -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g -pthread -ldiscord -lcurl -lcrypto -lpthread -lm -lsqlite3 && ./main.out
```

8 - The bot is probably online, use !play <music> and feel free to listen to your favorite musics.
